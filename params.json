The program relies on iwlist output for the scanning process. After the user is done, they can save the collected information as an XML file.\r\n\r\n![WifiScanAndMap scanner run as a GTK+ application](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/599926/images/screenshot-wifiscanner.png \"WifiScanAndMap scanner run as a GTK+ application\")\r\n\r\nThe scanner can be run as a GTK+ application or as a command line application (with the `–no-gui` parameter).\r\n\r\nThis process can be repeated any number of times, resulting in a number of XML files. These XML files are used as the input of the map generator program which parses the XML files and produces an HTML web page.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map data used is obtained from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and the tiles are from [Yahoo! Maps](http://maps.yahoo.com/). The graph is displayed using the [Bluff Javascript library](http://bluff.jcoglan.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\nTo run the scanner you need:\r\n\r\n* A Linux system with wireless tools for Linux installed\r\n* Wireless card supporting scanning\r\n* GPS receiver\r\n* Python 2.6.4\r\n* gpsd (+python bindings)\r\n* PyGTK+ 2.16 (if you want to use the GUI)\r\n\r\nTo display the map you need:\r\n\r\n* A web browser supporting CSS with Javascript enabled\r\n* An active internet connection\r\n\t\r\n### Usage:\r\n\r\n* You can run the scanner (GTK+ GUI) with the command :\r\n`python scanner/scanner.py`\r\n\r\n* You can run the scanner (GTK+ GUI) with the command :\r\n`python scanner/scanner.py –no-gui`\r\n\r\n* You can run the map generator with the command:\r\n`python mapgenerator/mapgenerator.py <longitude> <latitude> <output directory> <input XML file 1> <input XML file 2> … <input XML file n>`\r\n    \r\n    where:\r\n    * `<longitude>` and `<latitude>` are the geographic coordinates of the resulting map’s original center\r\n    * `<output directory>` is the directory where the result files will be saved\r\n    * `<input XML file 1> <input XML file 2> … <input XML file n>` are the XML files generated by the scanner.\r\n\r\n### Authors:\r\n\r\n* Δόβα Φιλία (Dova Filia) filia_do@hotmail.com\r\n* Μίγδος Γεώργιος (Migdos George) cyberpython@gmail.com\r\n\r\n### License:\r\nThe source code is available under the [Apache v2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\r\n\r\nThe artwork is available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\r\n\r\nThe 3rd party [Bluff Javascript library](http://bluff.jcoglan.com/) is available under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
